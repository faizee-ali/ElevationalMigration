# ElevationalMigration

This is an ongoing project on Characterizing, calculating and understanding(the drivers of) Elevational Migration of resient birds in the southern western Ghats.
The different steps I performed to filter ebird data, spatially thin checklists, resample occurances, calculate elevational shifts and perform PGLS are uploaded as
folders with R scripts and some subsidairy data.
